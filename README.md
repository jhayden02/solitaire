# Raylib Template

This template gives you a starting point for jumping into using Raylib!

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for complete instructions on how to set up your development environment.

The template is set up for Windows or Linux, with web compilation (Emscripten) being possible
on both. The project uses GitHub Pages to host the web-compiled game in a separate branch,
[gh-pages](https://github.com/jhayden02/raylib_template/tree/gh-pages). GitHub Workflows
re-compiles the game to this branch on each push in the event source files are changed.

To play the most recent commit of the game hosted on GitHub Pages, go [here](https://jhayden02.github.io/raylib_template/).

The link to your GitHub Pages page will always follow this pattern:
* https://username.github.io/repository_name/
